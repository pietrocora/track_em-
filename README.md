Tracking an erodible bed of glass beads under a turbulent flow 

We have high speed videos of particle movement and need to extract statistical distributions for kinematics. 


align_in_time: 
	this uses the calibration flash to align the video stereopairs (works)
image_generator: 
	given a video this turns the video into a series of images (works)
image_renamer: 
	change the naming convention of an entire folder of videos (works)
image_to_binary: 
	turn a video into solely black and white-- works but needs a second look
light_masker: 
	remove the blazing sun from the lights so that the beads pop out. Needs work-- kinda works
video_joiner: 
	joins the videos together from the m5 (works) 
video_to_immages: 
	uhh is this the same as image_generator? Need to look.
